**Project Brief: PokéDex Explorer**

Welcome to your Angular learning project! You're going to build a PokéDex Explorer application using a public API. This is a step-by-step project that will help you discover and apply many of Angular's core features.

### Project Goal

Build a Pokémon browser app that allows users to:

* View a list of Pokémon
* View detailed info about each Pokémon
* Navigate between different pages
* Handle routing and protected routes
* Display data dynamically with user interaction

You will receive new milestones after completing and discussing each step with your mentor. Do not rush. You must explore Angular's official documentation and community resources before implementing features.

### Tools

* [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
* Angular (latest version)
