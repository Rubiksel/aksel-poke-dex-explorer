# PokéDex Explorer

A Pokémon browser application built with Angular that allows users to explore the world of Pokémon using the PokéAPI.

## Project Overview

This Angular application serves as a training project for interns to learn and apply core Angular concepts. The PokéDex Explorer will allow users to:

- Browse a list of Pokémon
- View detailed information about each Pokémon
- Navigate between different pages
- Experience protected routes
- Interact with dynamically displayed data

## Technologies Used

- Angular (Latest version)
- TypeScript
- Signals for reactive programming
- Angular Router
- [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for Pokémon data

## Project Structure

This section will be filled in as you develop the application. Consider how you might organize your code using Angular best practices.

## Development Milestones

The project is divided into 10 progressive milestones:

1. **Project Initialization**: Setting up the Angular project and landing page
2. **Navigation**: Implementing routing between components
3. **API Integration**: Fetching and displaying Pokémon data from PokéAPI
4. **Component Interaction**: Creating reusable Pokémon components with inputs/outputs
5. **Reactivity**: Implementing reactive state management
6. **Derived State**: Managing selected/filtered Pokémon data
7. **Async Data Handling**: Implementing loading states and error handling
8. **Custom Directives & Pipes**: Enhancing the UI with custom Angular features
9. **Route Guards**: Implementing protected routes
10. **HTTP Interceptors**: Adding global HTTP request/response handling
